To compile project you need register RZDCX.dll located in the project directory using regsvr32 [path to project]\rzdcx.dll. 

On windows 7, 8 and vista, regsvr32 should run as administrator 

For example, if you un-zipped code into folder C:\PDFToDICOM - open command prompt window as administrator and enter: 

regsvr32  C:\PDFToDICOM\rzdcx.dll.
